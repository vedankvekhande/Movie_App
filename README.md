# üçø How to Run the Website on Your System
Note :- I have already deployed the github live code on server here :- https://movie-app-ymkw.vercel.app/
Still If it's not up or you want to run code in local system then follow below set of instructions. 

## Step 1: Download and Extract the Code

Firstly, download the entire website code and extract the ZIP file to a folder on your local system.

## Step 2: Install and run the node dependencies.

Open folder at 'myapp' from terminal and then install all node dependencies using 'npm install'.


## Step 3: Run the Website

Open your code editor (such as VS Code) and navigate to the project directory. Then, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the application. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the website.

Note: Ensure that you have carefully added the TMDB API key and Firebase authentication configuration to your .env file. If the .env file is not working, add all the API keys and configuration manually.
